# UFOs
## Overview: 
 The purpose of this project is to create an HTML that displays UFO sightings and their descriptions. We were tasked to create multiple filters in the HTML to make the analysis more dynamic for the users.
## Results: 
-  When a user visits the UFO Sightings default page, they may become overwhelmed with the amount of data available to them. This led to creating filters so users can find exactly what they are looking for and make the data less overwhelming.
###### UFO Homepage

- The table that was made for Dana is efficient for looking into specific details of UFO Sightings. This new table will allow users to use multiple filters at once to pin-point a city, shape description, and a state.

- You may have noticed that California is THE UFO sighting central and has multiple cities, dates, and shaped descriptions listed. Users can easily zero in on a city like "el cajon" and view the different dates and shapes associated with that location by simply typing it into the filter tab.
###### Filtered Sightings

## Summary: 
- One draw back of this webpage is the navigation, users can not return back to the default location without using the refresh button everytime.
- One recommendation for further development is correcting some of the texts in the comments log, there are a few descriptions that have integers or a '#' in place of letters. This can be difficult for users to read.
###### Numerical symbols in comments

- Secondly, I suggest removing sightings with a dureation of less than a few seconds and remove comments that could be debunked to be meteors.
